== Description

Ruby bindings for Libarchive.

Libarchive is a programming library that can create and read several different streaming archive formats, including most popular tar variants, several cpio formats, and both BSD and GNU ar variants.

== Support archive (from Libarchive 2.6.0)
=== reading
* gzip compression
* bzip2 compression
* compress/LZW compression
* GNU tar format (including GNU long filenames, long link names, and
  sparse files)
* Solaris 9 extended tar format (including ACLs)
* Old V7 tar archives
* POSIX ustar
* POSIX pax interchange format
* POSIX octet-oriented cpio
* SVR4 ASCII cpio
* Binary cpio (big-endian or little-endian)
* ISO9660 CD-ROM images (with optional Rockridge extensions)
* ZIP archives (with uncompressed or "deflate" compressed entries)
* GNU and BSD 'ar' archives
* 'mtree' format
  * lzma compression not supported

=== writing
* gzip compression
* bzip2 compression
* compress/LZW compression
* POSIX ustar
* POSIX pax interchange format
* "restricted" pax format, which will create ustar archives except for entries that require pax extensions (for long filenames, etc).
  * ACLs not supported
* POSIX octet-oriented cpio
* SVR4 "newc" cpio
* shar archives
* GNU and BSD 'ar' archives

== Example
=== reading archive
    require 'libarchive_ruby'
    
    Archive.read_open_filename('foo.tar.gz') do |ar|
      while entry = ar.next_header
        name = entry.pathname
        data = ar.read_data
    
        #data = ""
        #ar.read_data(1024) do |x|
        #  data << x
        #end
    
        puts "#{name} (size=#{data.size})"
      end
    end

=== creating archive
    require 'libarchive_ruby'
    
    Archive.write_open_filename('foo.tar.bz2', Archive::COMPRESSION_BZIP2, Archive::FORMAT_TAR_USTAR) do |ar|
      Dir.glob('*.c').each do |fn|
        ar.new_entry do |entry|
          entry.copy_stat(fn)
          entry.pathname = fn
          ar.write_header(entry)
          ar.write_data(open(fn) {|f| f.read })
    
          #open(fn) do |f|
          #  ar.write_data do
          #    f.read(1024)
          #  end
          #end
        end
      end
    end

=== creating archive by extarnal program
    require 'libarchive_ruby'
    
    Archive.write_open_filename('foo.tar.lzo', 'lzop', Archive::FORMAT_TAR_USTAR) do |ar|
      ...
    end
